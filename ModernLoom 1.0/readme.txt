Modern Loom Mod for Starbound
Author: Rawkinrex update of an I Said No Mod

========
Purpose:
========
This is a simple mod that creates a modern upgrade to the wooden spinning wheel object.

=============
Installation:
=============
Navigate to your Starbound mods folder. For steam installs, this is typically "(drive)/Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Starbound/mods. Place the modpack file in this folder

To remove the mod, simply delete it from the folder.

===========
How to Use:
===========
Craft the Modern Loom at a Metalwork Station for 3 iron bars, 1 copper bar and a Yarn Spinner. It's functionally identical to the spinning wheel but looks
more modern looking so it doesn't clash with your other crafting stations.
