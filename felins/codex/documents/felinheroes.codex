		"There are three Felin of Legend, pinnacles in their art, whose example all felin are highly suggested to follow.

Felin may have no Gods, but they certainly have their Heroes.",
		"The first Hero is The Hunter, Chelsie. Her name is not like most other felin, for she was born off-world and contaminated by the local culture in a way that helped increase her hunting prowess to incredible heights. Her strategic skill was likewise commendable and she was as wise as she was beautiful.",
		"The second Hero is The Healer, Letrune. Starting as a simple nurse to a respected doctor of the flesh, her caring deeds continue to inspire Comforters around the entire span of the felin species' influence. She is said to have a bottomless love for other beings who require her care and attention.",
		"The third and last Hero is the Leader, Laenathin. A leonid of noble stock, and one of very few felin with a full beard as glorious as his leadership. He was a highly learned Scholar, and responsible for most significant developments of felin culture and expansion, until he untimely death."
