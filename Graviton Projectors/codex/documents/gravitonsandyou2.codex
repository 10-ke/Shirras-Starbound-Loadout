    "My graviton experiments have led me to the design of a device - or rather a pair of devices - which employ a graviton field. These 'pads' and 'rings' can be aligned so that they can be used in the fashion of an elevator.",
    
    "These are constructed from properly aligned graviton magnifiers installed with circuit boards housed in titanium casings. Blueprints for which can be found within this book.",
    
    "The titanium casing can be replaced with one made from several other types of metals or composite alloys, the density of which can improve the ability of the device to manipulate the projected graviton field."
