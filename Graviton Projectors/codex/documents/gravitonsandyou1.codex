    "One of the most difficult to harness particles, gravitons should be treated with caution. Applied safely, they can be utilized in a number of ways and I am sure brighter minds than I will come up with more.",

    "A graviton magnifier is a vital component however in any device that is to make practical use of gravitons - you will find diagrams within this book for the construction of such, although proper equipment is required.",

    "^green;Several technical pages follow detailing the relevant circuitry and energizing the core fragment. You can now craft a ^orange;Graviton Magnifier ^green;from a ^orange;Crystal ^green;and ^orange;Laser Diode ^green;at a Wiring Station."
